# RELEASE NOTES

## 1.0 (16/02/2016)

### Features
- First prototype of StarPU Monitoring Broker with 2 APIs:
	mf_starpu_init();
	mf_starpu_task_train();
- StarPU Monitoring Broker is prepared as a library for general use.
- Test Experiments written and testing done on EXCESS cluster at HLRS.
- Scripts for running test cases are written for each experiment.
- Test results evaluation. Generating Performance model and power model as defined and plotting figures with respect to performance and power data.


## 1.1 (05/04/2016)

### Features
- Stable and more flexible version of StarPU Energy-aware Extension with 10 APIs:
	int mf_starpu_get_user(int argc, char **argv, char *user);
	int mf_starpu_get_task(int argc, char **argv, char *task);
	int mf_starpu_get_experiment_id(int argc, char **argv, char *exp_id);
	int mf_starpu_get_train_loops(int argc, char **argv);
	int mf_starpu_init(struct starpu_conf *conf, char *user, char *task, char *exp_id);
	int mf_starpu_task_training(struct starpu_task *task, unsigned nimpl);
	double mf_starpu_get_energy(long double start_t, long double end_t, unsigned ENERGY_TYPE);
	void mf_starpu_metrics_feed(struct starpu_task *task, unsigned nimpl, double energy);
	void mf_starpu_show_expectation(struct starpu_task *task, unsigned nimpl);
	long double mf_starpu_time(void);
- Scripts are provided to setup prerequisites and set environments on the EXCESS cluster.
- Makefile is able to build the source based on local machine or on the EXCESS cluster.
- Examples are combined with pbs job scripts for submitting to the EXCESS cluster.
